== DESCRIPTION:

Plugin for omnifocus gem to provide github BTS synchronization.

Support for Github Enterprise:

In your git config, set the key omnifocus-github.accounts to a space
separated list of github accounts. 

    git config --global omnifocus-github.accounts "github myghe"

For each account API end point and authentication information are
should be stored in the git config under a key matching the
account. For example:

    git config --global github.user me
    git config --global github.password mypassword
    git config --global myghe.api https://ghe.mydomain.com/api/v3
    git config --global myghe.token 1a2b3c4d5e6f7e8d

For each account can you specify the following parameters:

* api - specify an API endpoint other than
  https://api.github.com. This is so you can point this at your Github
  Enterprise endpoint.

* user, password - A username and password pair for Basic http authentication.

* token - An OAuth bearer token for OAuth workflows.

If both a token and a username and password are supplied, the token
is used.
